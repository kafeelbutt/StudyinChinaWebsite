Dar-UL-Ehsan Study Advisors are pioneers in sending students to pursue Medical Education in China. We have been sending students for MBBS in China for the past 13 years. To date we have sent around 600+ students. 250+ of our students have completed their course and are now gainfully employed in India, Gulf and UK in both private and government sectors.
Normally, admission/applications for good universities are accepted from April. We are currently representing eighteen universities in China (please see details in Colleges & Universities).
Here are some of the basic features of Medical Education in China. You may visualize an Indian Medical Education replica with the added advantage of ultra modern curriculum delivery method, state of art laboratories, introduction of latest western development in diagnostic techniques etc. The course/degree is accepted by Medical Council of India, World Health Organization and several other countries. Our 2004 to 2011 batch students have successfully completed the course and are gainfully employed in public and private sector hospitals in Hyderabad, Mysore, New Delhi, Mumbai and Jeddah. The students have total religious freedom and there is no restriction on Hijab. Hostel living conditions are excellent with two students to a room with air condition and heaters. Every hostel floor has a fully equipped kitchen (for those who would like to do self-cooking) – The hostel mess has a choice of Chinese and Muslim hallal food. Several supermarkets, banks and hospitals are within the campus itself.
There are stringent disciplinary administrative procedures at the university. There is absolute safety and security. We have a representative in the city where the college is located for the five year stay of the student – he speaks English, Hindi and Chinese perfectly and carries out mentoring work for the students. Right from receiving them from the airport to arranging their resident permits, vacations, assistance in medical care (if needed) and other hostel or college related issues.
The universities are duly recognized by WHO and listed by the Medical Council of India. The entire course is in English medium. However, every student has to learn the Chinese language – which is part of the curriculum (like a second language in India) – the reason for this is the student staying for 5 years will find life much easier. Secondly from third semester on wards they will be going for clinical studies and will interact with real patients – and they need to communicate hence the language is needed. The entire course is in English medium just an additional language is taught for the reasons stated above. The course is divided in 10 semesters of 6 months each and one-year internship (which can be done either in home country or in China itself). The classrooms, labs and library are state of art – professors are from China, India and Europe teaching in English language. Multimedia teaching aids are used. Practical and labs have excellent facility and 7 students get to share one body for dissection. Students can pursue their post graduation in China. They can also compete for a seat in PG entrance in India or write the USMLE or PLAB exams to pursue PG in USA or Europe.
More details of fees and admission process are given in the website.
You can apply online by sending documents to chinaadmissionhelp@gmail.com the documents are mention in http://chinaadmissionhelp.com/Pages/Contact.html which you want to send Thank you.
